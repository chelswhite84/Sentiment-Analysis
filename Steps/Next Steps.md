#Next Steps 

Although it is unfortunate that this sentiment analysis did not predict a clear winner, in the end the data shows that both devices have extremely high satisfaction ratings by customers, with almost 85% of reviews displaying the highest happiness rating, 5. This means that whichever device you chose, likely the medical staff using the application suite will be able to use either device with relative ease. As shown in the marketplace as well, consumers seem to have a personal preference but both devices perform at a similar level that they can become almost interchangeable. 

I would suggest looking more into the device features, Helio's business relationship with both companies, as well as what sort of resource restrictions may be common in the developed areas the aid staff is or may be working in. For example, the iPhone historically has a higher price point than Samsung Galaxy devices. Would this cause any issues in developing countries with more limited monetary resources? Also, the iPhone has its own individual charger while the Samsung Galaxy uses a Micro USB, which is a much more common connection and compatible with a multitude of chargers from other devices. Battery life may be another feature that could be considered since electricity may not always be easily available. Finally, examining carrier compatibility could offer some insights if one phone model is preferred over the other.
